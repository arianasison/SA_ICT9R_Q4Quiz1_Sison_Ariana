<h1 class="margin1">Banaue Rice Terraces</h1>
<p class="margin2">For many Filipinos, the Banaue Rice Terraces rank as the world's eighth most impressive natural wonder, and they are so designated as a Philippine national cultural treasure. It is likely that the terraces were cut by hand in the Ifugao highlands. In the hilly areas of Ifugao and northern Luzon Island, there are rice terraces that date back more than two thousand years.The original purpose of the terraces was to provide a more manageable growing environment for rice, as the terrain drops away at astonishing angles.<p></div>
